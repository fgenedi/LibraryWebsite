# LibraryWebsite
This project is a library website written in javaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Walkthrough: 
  Users can create accounts by signing up, if an unregistered user tries to login they will be shown an error message that they aren't registered then redirected to 
  the registration page, if a user tries entering an already existing username in the username field a "username already taken" error message will show. Users can then
  log in using their username and password, if the user entered a password that doesn't match the username an error message will show notifying the user that they entered
  an incorrect password. Users can then search for and view books. The search function works by matching what the user entered in the search box to the books' titles, even 
  if only a substring of the book's title matches the book will appear in the search results. Each book has a page containing information about the book like title, cover,
  blurb, and corresponding movie trailer that can be played. Users can also explore books according to genre, the available genres include fiction, novels, and poetry. Users 
  can add different books to their read list which they can access from the home page, in case a user tries to add a book to their readlist that is already there an error
  message will show notifying the user.
